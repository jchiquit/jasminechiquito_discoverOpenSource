# jasminechiquito_discoverOpenSource

This repository was created during the Girls Who Code College Loops Discover Open Source Challenge.

“This project is part of the Discover Open Source Challenge through Girls Who Code and College Loops. In this challenge, we responded to the following prompt:

Delilah is a self-starter, and she created an app to get young girls excited about learning technology. Many kids have already tested the app, and she has been getting very positive reviews.
Since Delilah sourced most of her user-testers through her network, their backgrounds are all very similar to hers. Delilah wants her app to be more inclusive, but she doesn’t know how to find and approach more potential user-testers from underrepresented minorities. What can be some first steps?

Delilah should share her app through social media and have her network share it too. It is relatively easy and quick. Social media can potentially reach a wide range of potential users. In addition, if Delilah lives in an area that is diverse, Delilah can advertise her app through flyers.
